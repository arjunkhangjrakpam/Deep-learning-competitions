# 1. Deep-learning-competitions
This repository contains projects that are part of the competitions I have taken part while taking the Deep Learning course offered by One-Fourth Labs. 
The list of competitions are :
1. MP Neuron - Like Unlike Classification[File name-]
   This competition is about whether we can predict if a mobile phone will be LIKED by people or NOT using an MP Neuron model?
2. Perceptron - Like Unlike Classification
   This competition is about whether we can predict if a mobile phone will be LIKED by people or NOT using Perceptron model?
# 2. Analytics Project
This repository has one analytics project which I had undertaken recently . In this project I have built a Logistic Regression model in R, predicted Customer Attrition in a Telecom sector Company and identified Target Segment for Proactive Customer Retention Campaigns and Revenue Maximisation. The project is stored in the file name- "Telecom Data Project on R.R".
