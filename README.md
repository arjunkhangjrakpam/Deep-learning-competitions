# Deep-learning-competitions
This repository contains projects that are part of the competitions I have taken part while taking the Deep Learning course offered by One-Fourth Labs. 
The list of competitions are :
1. MP Neuron - Like Unlike Classification
   This competition is about whether we can predict if a mobile phone will be LIKED by people or NOT using an MP Neuron model?
2. Perceptron - Like Unlike Classification
   This competition is about whether we can predict if a mobile phone will be LIKED by people or NOT using Perceptron model?
