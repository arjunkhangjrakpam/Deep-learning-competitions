# 1. Deep-learning-competitions
This repository as of now contains two projects that are part of the competitions I have taken part while taking the ongoing Deep Learning course offered by One-Fourth Labs. 
The list of competitions are :
1. MP Neuron - Like Unlike Classification
   This competition is about whether we can predict if a mobile phone will be LIKED by people or NOT using an MP Neuron model?
   The code for this competition is stored in the file name "mp_neuron_b_6.ipynb".
   
2. Perceptron - Like Unlike Classification
   This competition is about whether we can predict if a mobile phone will be LIKED by people or NOT using Perceptron model?
   The code for this competition is stored in the file name "Perceptron_Like_Unlike_Classification.ipynb".
   
**The train and test datasets for the above two competitions are available as test.csv and train.csv files.
